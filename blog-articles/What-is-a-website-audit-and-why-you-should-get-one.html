          <p class="service__paragraph text-start">Having a website for your business is a must these days, when modern people spend hours on the internet. Even when having a website is only an option for your type of business, it's still highly recommended to have one. Your website will build credibility and leads and will help you learn more about your customers.</p>
          <p class="service__paragraph text-start">Do you already have a website? Maybe you paid for one, or perhaps you chose to create one yourself, but have you ever thought if your website is good enough? Are you using it at its maximum potential? Is it bringing you enough leads? First, you should aim for more than good. Your website is the mirror of your business, so you shouldn't neglect it even if it's easy to get caught in your day-to-day business, administrative and personal tasks.</p>
          <p class="service__paragraph text-start">Think of your site as a complex machine that needs regular website maintenance and website update to work at its best. If you want to ensure your website rises above a certain standard, I recommend auditing your website regularly. A regular audit provides a benchmark for future improvements and helps you rectify significant issues. I recommend an annual audit for small websites and twice per year audit for larger websites.</p>
          <p class="service__paragraph reason text-start">What is a website audit, and why should you get one?</p>
          <p class="service__paragraph text-start">A website audit is a complete analysis of all the factors that affect a website's visibility. This method gives a comprehensive insight into overall traffic and individual pages for any website. We can break down an audit into SEO, design, user experience, performance, maintenance, the lead generation process, social media presence, and content audit.</p>
          <p class="service__paragraph text-start">An audit identifies your website's problems and gives you the possibility to improve its performance. Assessing these areas will provide you with a complete picture of the current effectiveness of your site, show where you may be able to optimize further and improve it â€“ and identify issues that could be causing damage. It's an essential measure to improve the efficiency and visibility of your website.</p>
          <p class="service__paragraph text-start">This will help you understand:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>why your website is not generating enough traffic</li>
            <li>why your conversion rates and sales are not increasing</li>
            <li>what technical issues exist</li>
            <li>your website performance</li>
            <li>how easy it is for users to navigate the site</li>
            <li>SEO issues</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="service__paragraph reason text-start">What can you expect after a website audit?</p>
          <p class="service__paragraph text-start">Of course, identifying issues is just the first part of the process. The second part includes fixing them.
            You will receive a summary report including any errors found and the most effective way to correct them.
            Based on the errors we found on your website and our suggested recommendations, you can decide if you will take this on your own, or you may consider getting the professional help <a href="https://www.webdevandmedia.com/">that's us :) .</a> Either way, you will know how your website needs to be improved </p>
          <p class="service__paragraph reason text-start">How can I have a website audit?</p>
          <p class="service__paragraph text-start">Send us a message <a href="../index.html#contact">here</a>, and you will get a complete expert audit report for your website with no obligations. </p>
          <p class="service__paragraph text-start">A website audit should become a priority once you've invested in building your entire website and the content. If you don't see the traffic results expected from the organic results or if you've seen a decline in organic traffic, it's crucial to do site audits to ensure no issues are affecting your site.
            It will help identify errors that can be addressed. An audit gets down to the root of the problems, so changes can be made to improve your site's search visibility.</p>
